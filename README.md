# Inheritance task
There are several classes in the ``animals`` package. The ``Dog`` class has its own **fields** and **methods**, and there are three classes for different dog breeds: ``Bulldog``, ``Doberman``, and ``Beagle``. The breed classes currently **don't have their own fields and methods**, but I need them to have the fields and methods from the ``Dog`` class.
**Inherit** the ``Dog`` class in each of the breed classes and run the test to check if you have completed the task correctly.
